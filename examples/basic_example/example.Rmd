title: "Basic Hmsc-HPC usage example"
output: html_notebook
---

This notebook demonstrates the concept of using Hmsc-HPC extension for `Hmsc` package. Unlike the core `Hmsc`, the Hmsc-HPC extension is written in Python programming language and is executed with Python interpreter. Hence, before a user can use it, a proper Python installation is required. 

### Checking Python and TensorFlow installation

Depending on your hardware, operating system and user rights, the set of steps to acquire and configure a proper Python distribution may greatly vary. Thus, we would like to relay the installation process itself either to one of multitude guides available on the web, or to the IT support that manages your device. However, we would like to provide some simple advice how-to credibly and quickly ensure whether the following examples in this notebook shall be expected to execute well or not.

For this purpose, we propose you to test the next chunk of code that tries to check version of Python available in you system, and to execute a basic TensorFlow-based command: 
```{r}
testPythonCode = "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.constant(1))"
system("python --version", wait=TRUE)
system(sprintf("python -c '%s'", testPythonCode), wait=TRUE)
```
If Python distribution in your system is configured well, then the code shall print the version of Python and check the availability of TensorFlow package by printing a scalar. If the first part is failing, they you are likely missing Python altogether, or its path is not configured. If the second line fails, then TensorFlow is not installed, and you shall acquire it, e.g. following the guidelines from the developer's website.

Please note that in some cases you may have several distributions of Python available, and the one intended for Hmsc-HPC is not the default choice. Then you shall either explicitly specify the path to the desired Python distribution --- as we demonstrate in the code chunk below, or use other means to reconfigure it - for instance, `reticulate` package features several functions aimed to achieve that. 

```{r}
pythonPath = "/Users/gtikhono/opt/anaconda3/envs/tf/bin/python3"
system(sprintf("%s --version", pythonPath), wait=TRUE)
system(sprintf("%s -c '%s'", pythonPath, testPythonCode), wait=TRUE)
```
We strongly recommend that you ensure that the code chunk above executes well, as we would reuse the same path to relevant Python distribution later on throought this notebook.


# Setting a toy Hmsc model
First, we shall acquire a sufficiently recent `Hmsc` package. Most likely, the actual distribution on CRAN is already suitable, but most certainly it can be done from the master branch of `Hmsc` repo on GitHub.
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("hmsc-r/HMSC")
```

Next, we load the required packages. We also set up the path to the working directory and the path to the Hmsc-HPC package. Assuming that you have downloaded this notebook as a part of the distributed Hmsc-HPC extension, the pre-set relative paths shall work fine. Otherwise, please note that these are user and system-specific, therefore you shall ensure their correctness yourself. 

```{r}
library(Hmsc)
library(jsonify)
packagePath = "../../hmsc-hpc"
python_file_path = file.path(packagePath, "hmsc/examples/run_gibbs_sampler.py")
```

Next, we introduce the fundamental model fitting parameters determining the MCMC sampling: number of samples to obtain per MCMC chain, thinning and number of chains. We also define the regularity of progress printing during MCMC sampling. We set the transient phase being equally long as the sampling phase. 

```{r}
nSamples = 100
thin = 2
nChains = 4
verbose = 10
transient = nSamples * thin
```

For the sake of this example close-to-online run times, we deliberately use short MCMC chains that are not expected to reach sufficient convergence. This example can be rerun with longer MCMC chains to ensure their convergence.

We use the `TD` synthetic data, included to the `Hmsc` package for the demonstration purposes. In practice, the users would have to define the model with their own data. We set up the model with `Hmsc(...)` call and fit it with  

```{r}
summary(TD)
m = Hmsc(Y=TD$Y, XData=TD$X, XFormula=~., TrData=TD$Tr[,-1], TrFormula=~., phyloTree=TD$phy,
         studyDesign=TD$studyDesign, ranLevels=list(plot=TD$rL1, sample=TD$rL2))
```


### Standard Hmsc-R fitting

Next, we obtain the reference by fitting `m` using the standard way with `sampleMcmc(...)` call. 
```{r include=FALSE, results='hide'}
fitR = sampleMcmc(m, samples=nSamples, thin=thin, transient=transient, nChains=nChains, verbose=200, engine="R")
```
We also visualize some possible post-fitting postprocessing available in `Hmsc`package --- by the estimated partition of variance in the fitted model.
```{r}
plotVariancePartitioning(fitR, computeVariancePartitioning(fitR), args.legend=list(x="bottomright"))
```

# Exporting model for Hmsc-HPC 

In order to use Hmsc-HPC, we need to export the model object, created by `Hmsc(...)` call. Also, the current design of `Hmsc-R` and `Hmsc-HPC` interplay requires that the model initialization, which happens just before the MCMC chains are run, is conducted in R. Thus, we use special keyword in the call `sampleMcmc(..., engine="HPC)`, which denotes that we are not interested in sampling the model, but only to initialize the sampling. We save the resulted object in obligatory JSON+RDS format to the working directory.

```{r}
init_obj = sampleMcmc(m, samples=nSamples, thin=thin, transient=transient, nChains=nChains, verbose=verbose, engine="HPC")
init_file_name = "init_file.rds"
saveRDS(to_json(init_obj), file=init_file_name)
```

# Hmsc-HPC for sequential chains' execution 

As the Hmsc-HPC operates in Python, in the next step we programmatically formulate the required call.

```{r}
pythonPath = "/Users/gtikhono/opt/anaconda3/envs/tf/bin/python3"
post_file_name = "post_file.rds"
cat(sprintf("export PYTHONPATH='%s':$PYTHONPATH", normalizePath(packagePath)), "\n")
python_cmd = paste(sprintf("'%s' '%s'", pythonPath, normalizePath(python_file_path)),
                   sprintf("--input '%s'", file.path(getwd(), init_file_name)),
                   sprintf("--output '%s'", file.path(getwd(), post_file_name)),
                   "--samples", nSamples,
                   "--transient", transient,
                   "--thin", thin,
                   "--verbose", verbose)
cat(python_cmd, "\n")
```

In this example we implicitly focus on the case of using local machine for MCMC execution, but any properly set-up machine can be used --- the user just need to move the initialized object there. 

### Running Python model fitting script 

If the user is savvy in running Python scripts from R, then the outputted calls can be executed as a part of R script execution. While this can be accomplished by executing the next chunk of code, we personally have found it to be very sensitive to a very proper Python configuration. Thus, at this stage we recommend to run a shell (command line) and simply paste the two calls, produced by the last chunk there - at least during the user's learning of Hmsc-HPC workflow.

```{r}
system(sprintf("export PYTHONPATH='%s':$PYTHONPATH; %s", normalizePath(packagePath), python_cmd), wait=TRUE)
```

### Importing computed posterior to R 

Once the Python call has conducted, the following step is to import the calculated posterior samples back to R. We start by reading the output of `Hmsc-HPC`, which is a stacked list of fitted chains and time elapsed for model fitting.
```{r}
importFromHPC = from_json(readRDS(file = post_file_name)[[1]])
postList = importFromHPC[1:nChains]
cat(sprintf("fitting time %.1f sec\n", importFromHPC[[nChains+1]]))
```

A fitted Hmsc-R model differs from its unfitted counterpart in two aspects. First, it contains information on the sampling being done. Next, it accommodates the list of fitted MCMC, each of which is a list of posterior samples for that chain. Both adjustments are made with a novel function of the `Hmsc` package, called `importPosteriorFromHPC(...)` that takes the unfitted model, imported list of chains produced by Hmsc-HPC and the core MCMC settings that were used for the fitting.

```{r}
fitTF = importPosteriorFromHPC(m, postList, nSamples, thin, transient)
```

We finalize by plotting the variance partition again --- just to ensure the integrity of the resulted object.

```{r}
plotVariancePartitioning(fitTF, computeVariancePartitioning(fitTF), args.legend=list(x="bottomright"))
```


# Hmsc-HPC for potentially concurrent chains' execution 

If the model fitting with Hmsc-HPC is conducted locally, then there is typically no need for parallel execution of chains. However, if the user's machine features multiple GPUs or a specialized CPU with very large number of cores, there is a need to provide an opportunity for the MCMC being run in parallel. Furhtermore, this is the intended pathway especially once fitting is conducted with HPC infrastructure. Hence, we provide an example of how to execute such pathway as well.

For this purpose, we need to create chain-specific Python calls, so that each one will handle a single particular chain.

```{r}
chain_cmd_list = vector("list", nChains)
for(cInd in 1:nChains){
  chain_file_name = sprintf("post_chain%.2d_file.rds", cInd-1)
  chain_cmd = paste(sprintf("'%s' '%s'", pythonPath, normalizePath(python_file_path)),
                     sprintf("--input '%s'", file.path(getwd(), init_file_name)),
                     sprintf("--output '%s'", file.path(getwd(), chain_file_name)),
                     "--samples", nSamples,
                     "--transient", transient,
                     "--thin", thin,
                     "--verbose", verbose,
                     "--chain", cInd-1)
  cat(chain_cmd, "\n")
  chain_cmd_list[[cInd]] = chain_cmd
}
```

Next step is to appropriately execute each of these calls. For the sake of runability of this notebook im most users' devices, here we manually mimic the job scheduler, while an example of doing it properly in a `Slurm`-based HPC cluster is provided in the next section. The principal difference from the single call considers above is that each call's output is a separate file with chain-specific results.

```{r}
for(cInd in 1:nChains){
  system(sprintf("export PYTHONPATH='%s':$PYTHONPATH; %s", normalizePath(packagePath), chain_cmd_list[[cInd]]), wait=TRUE)
}
```

Therefore, once all Python calls have conducted, the following step is to import the calculated posterior samples back to R. We exemplify it as following.

```{r}
chainList = vector("list", nChains)
for(cInd in 1:nChains){
  chain_file_name = sprintf("post_chain%.2d_file.rds", cInd-1)
  chainList[[cInd]] = from_json(readRDS(file = chain_file_name)[[1]])[[1]]
}
```

The remaining steps remain identical to the previously shown alternative.

```{r}
fitSepTF = importPosteriorFromHPC(m, chainList, nSamples, thin, transient)
plotVariancePartitioning(fitSepTF, computeVariancePartitioning(fitSepTF), args.legend=list(x="bottomright"))
```


# Running Hmsc-HPC in a cluster

Different computational clusters greatly diverge in how software and scripts are run, both in terms of execution characteristics and in user interface. Thus, it is close to impossible to properly cover all the alternatives related to how Hmsc-HPC can be run in HPC that the particular user is interested and has access to. Therefore, we focus on how we have done it with the HPC under `Slurm` cluster management and job scheduling system, which is used by CSC of Finland that provided HPC resources for this research project.

### Script for parallel execution of chains

The following script shall be run with `sbatch` command from the user interface node of the cluster. 

```{bash eval=FALSE}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=project_123456789
#SBATCH --ntasks=1 --cpus-per-task=4
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=32G --gpus-per-node=1
#SBATCH --time=00:14:59 --partition=small-g
#SBATCH --array=0-3

module load tensorflow/2.12
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/../../hmsc-hpc:$PYTHONPATH

SAM=${1:-100}
THIN=${2:-10}

input_path="init_file.rds"
output_path="post_file.rds"
output_path=$(printf "post_chain%.2d_file.rds" $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID)

srun python3 $PYTHONPATH/hmsc/examples/run_gibbs_sampler.py --input $input_path --output $output_path --samples $SAM --transient $(($SAM*$THIN)) --thin $THIN --verbose 100 --chain $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID
```

The header of the script may vary according to the used `Slurm` specification, so please consult the help webpage or IT support of the HPC resource that you intend to use. Namely, we have encountered differences in two different clusters iven though these were both run by the same CSC operator. Particularly this presented script was used for runs in LUMI supercomputer.
